# CS5610: Academic course Project 

###	Motivation and Overview

Personal consumption responsible for almost 70% of economic output. Itâ€™s the main workhorse that drives economic growth, making it a key component of GDP. Investors, businesses, and policymakers closely follow published statistics and reports on consumer spending in order to help forecast and plan investment and policy decisions.

During the first quarter of 2020, the US, along with most of the other parts of the world, were severely affected by the Covid19 pandemic and the economy took a huge hit. Travel restrictions went in place, curfews and lockdowns closed most businesses and even shut some of them down for good. The year 2020 demanded a huge adjustment from every level of the economy. Businesses laid off workers to reduce costs, leading to high unemployment rates; and most individuals who remained employed transitioned into remote work to reduce exposure to the virus. 

This project in intended to explore the spending habits of US consumers before the pandemic and during the pandemic to identify how consumers adjusted their spending, if at all. It provides us an opportunity to understand how consumer spending responded to the associated fear, anxiety and economic instability of Covid-19.

### Related Work

### Initial Questions

The overall expenditure figures indicate that consumption decreased during the year 2020. Which income group, ethnic group, age group, or occupation group were mostly responsible for this decline?

What type of goods or services saw a rise or decline in consumption? 

Is there any expenditure group that is correlated with income or any of the other expenditure groups? E.g. Does Healthcare expenditure decrease as Personal Insurance increase? Does the consumption in Transportation decrease as the Housing expenditure increase?

### Data
Data sources include the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S Bureau of Economic Analysis. More specifically, we looked at the real personal consumption expenditure tables for 2018, 2019, and 2020. 
We imported these tables and filtered them to include the six demographics of U.S consumers we wanted to explore; Income, Race, Age, Education, Occupation, and Generation. We later excluded generation as it was highly correlated with Age. 



### Exploratory Data Analysis


### Data Analysis
In order to identify relationships within the expenditure groups and Income we created scatterplots to determine which expenditure groups should we include in a multiple regression analysis. With the scatterplot visual, we determined that Transportation, Healthcare, and Education did not show signs of any relationship with Income so we excluded them from the regression model and used Housing, Food, Entertainment, and Personal Insurance and Pensions.
